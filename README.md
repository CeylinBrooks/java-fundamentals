## Java Methods

A method that "flips a coin" until a determined number of flips is acheived for the heads side of the coin. The method lets it be known how long it took to to reach that predetermined number.


### Pluralize

A method that takes in a word and returns that word with an 's', in turn making it pluralized! (Based on that number being 0 or more than on)

## Dice Roll

A method that takes in a array of six random numbers and uses the Math.random function for the "roll" of the dice.

## Contains Duplicates 

A method uses booleans to return true or false based on if the array contains duplicates.
